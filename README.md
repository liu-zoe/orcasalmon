## __Project Description__
A dashboard visualizing Chinook salmon population of the Fraser River (data from Albion, BC) and Columbia River (data from Bonneville Dam, Oregon) and its association with southern resident killer whales sightings in and around Puget Sound. 

### **Data**
#### Salmon Data
1. Albion Chinook test fishery is located on the lower Fraser River at Albion, BC (near Fort Langley), Canada. The fishery collects data from early April to mid-October every year. Catching per unit effort, or CPUE, is defined as catch per thousand fathom minutes. Data is retrieved from the Fisheries and Oceans Canada [report website](https://www-ops2.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fos2_Internet/Testfish/rptcsbdparm.cfm?stat=CPTFM&fsub_id=242). Read more about the Albion Chinook gill net data set, such as what size of net is used, in this document on [Albion Chinook Gillnet](https://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fm-gp/fraser/docs/commercial/albionchinook-quinnat-eng.html). 

2. Bonneville Dam data is retrieved from Columbia Basin Research [Adult Passage Queries](https://www.cbr.washington.edu/dart/query/adult_daily). Number of adult Chinook salmon passing through the Bonneville Dam was directly monitored April to October, with video monitoring covering the other months. See [Fish Passage Center] (https://www.fpc.org/adults/Q_adults_subsite.php) for more details. 

#### Orca Data
1. Orca sightings data is retrieved from [Acartia](https://acartia.io/home), a decentralized data cooperative for sharing marine animal locations within the Salish Sea.
