We saw them as they headed north past Lime Kiln in the late afternoon. J47 Notch, pictured here, has, when we have seen him, been going back and forth between his grieving mother J35 Tahlequah and hanging out with some other young males in J-Pod. Yesterday he was in with J38 Cookie and L105 Fluke, among others. J50 Scarlet was present also. (The August 1 update is J35 Tahlequah is still carrying her deceased daughter, for nine days now. It's difficult to imagine what she has been going through or the effort required to carry her baby hundreds of miles. We hope she finds the right time to let go, and that the body of her newborn returns peacefully to the sea. We are all struggling alongside her as we watch from afar, with a renewed fire to do whatever we can on behalf of the Southern Residents.) -Monika Wieland Shields, OBI",8,31,2018,Aug,Aug-31,2018-8-31,22:02:28,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
