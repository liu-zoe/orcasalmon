Data Courtesy of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
USACE Data Disclaimer: These data are furnished with the understanding that the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers makes no warranties concerning the accuracy; reliability; or suitability of this data for any particular 
purpose.
USACE Dams Video and Live Counting: From November through March; video tape fish counting occurs 
at US Army Corps of Engineers dams with fish ladders on the Columbia and Snake Rivers. Fish counting by video tape 
takes at least a few days to process: the fish counters have to make; collect; and read the tapes; and then submit 
their fish counts. DART retrieves and posts the data as soon as it is made available. On April 1; live fish counting 
resumes at all 8 Columbia River and Snake River Corps dams with fish ladders: from April through October each year 
for 16 hours each day; fish counters working at each fish ladder look directly into the fish ladders to count the 
fish passing by.
Temperature (TempC) is reported in degrees Celsius. Source of temperature  data varies by project. At most projects; it is scrollcase or water quality temperature data. At Wells; it is the Fishway Attraction Flow temperature which is pumped from tailrace.
Steelhead Counts: The Steelhead parameter includes both hatchery and wild counts. Prior to 1995 
wild steelhead data was not published on a daily basis. The Steelhead-Wild parameter is a subset of the total 
steelhead and may include unmarked hatchery fish.
Chinook Run Dates: Chinook runs (referring to the season when adults migrate upstream) are based on run schedules by project as reported by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; Yakima Klickitat Fisheries Project and Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.
